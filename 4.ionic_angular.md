# CLI commands
```sh
ionic create #create page, component, service etc. Generated pages are lazy loaded.
```

# ionic pages
- Page is a **special type of angular component** present in ionic. They act as a complete view.
- Instead of ```recipes.component.ts``` we get ```recipes.page.ts```.
- Pages have their own router ```recipes-routing.module.ts```.
- Pages can have multiple components under them.

## nested pages
```sh
ionic create page recipes/recipe-details
```
**recipe-details** page is a child of **recipes** page. It's route is registered inside ```recipes-routing.module.ts```.

## route path variable
For **recipe-details** route set path as
```ts
path: ':recipeId',//variable
```
```recipeId``` is extracted in ```RecipeDetailPage``` using ```ActivatedRoute``` observable provided by angular router.
```ts
  constructor(
    private activatedRoute: ActivatedRoute,
    private recipesService: RecipesService
  ) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.activatedRoute.paramMap.subscribe(paramMap => {//observer
      if (!paramMap.has("recipeId")) {
        return;
      }
      const recipeId = paramMap.get("recipeId");
      this.loadedRecipe = this.recipesService.getRecipe(recipeId);
      console.log(this.loadedRecipe.title);
    });
  }
```
