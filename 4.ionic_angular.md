# CLI commands
```sh
ionic create #create page, component, service etc. Generated pages are lazy loaded.
```

# ionic pages
- Page is a **special type of angular component** present in ionic. They act as a complete view.
- Instead of ```recipes.component.ts``` we get ```recipes.page.ts```.
- Pages have their own router ```recipes-routing.module.ts```.
- Pages can have multiple components under them.
